The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, processed, and stored in, a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland. In view of the EEA or Switzerland the law in some of those countries may not offer an adequate level of data protection. We only transfer data to these countries when it is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the exercise or defence of legal claims, or if such transfer is based on your explicit consent or subject to safeguards that assure the protection of your data, such as the US-EU Data Privacy Framework, the US-CH Data Privacy Framework and/or the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission (SCCs), adjusted according to Swiss law, all of the aforementioned if applicable and required.

## 6. Profiling and Automated Decision Taking

We analyse aspects of your individual's personality, behaviour, interest and habits make predictions or decisions about them for the purposes laid out in Section 2, e.g. to perform statistical analysis or to prevent misuse and security risks. This analysis identifies correlations between different behaviours and characteristics to create profiles for individuals. For example, we may use profiling to determine in which services you might be interested. We may also use profiling to assess your creditworthiness. We do not use profiling that can produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you without human review.

## 7. On-Chain Data

When you use blockchains, you acknowledge that your wallet address and other data/information provided by your transactions, which are considered personal data if relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, are permanently and publicly stored on-chain, which means such data is publicly available to anyone. Neither we, nor any third party, has any power to delete such data published by its users to the blockchain. If you want to ensure that your privacy rights are not affected in any way, you should not transact on blockchains as certain rights may not be available or exercisable by you or us due to the technological infrastructure of the blockchain.

You hereby release and indemnify us of any liability associated with data that you transferred to the blockchain.

## 8. Blockchain

## 9. Connected Wallets

The Giza UI uses "thirdweb", a service created by Non-Fungible Labs, Inc. (with registered offices in the US). Thirdweb allows you to connect third-party wallets to the Giza UI in order to use the Agent. Non-Fungible Labs, Inc. is solely responsible for processing the data associated with connecting your third-party wallet with the Giza UI. No personal data or wallet information is collected or processed by us during the connection of your third-party wallet and we have no access to or involvement in the data processing carried out by Non-Fungible Labs, Inc.

Upon expiry of the applicable retention period, we will securely destroy your data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

## 11. Data Security

We take appropriate organizational and technical security measures to prevent your data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed. However, we and your data can still become victims of cyber-attacks, cybercrime, brute force, hacker attacks and further fraudulent and malicious activity including but not limited to viruses, forgeries, malfunctions, and interruptions which is out of our control and responsibility. We have also put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

## 12. Your Rights

To the extent provided for by applicable law, you may request information free of charge about the data processed relating to you, its origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing. You may also have the right to correction, deletion, restriction, or objection to processing, as well as to the transfer of the data to another controller. Furthermore, you can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. All you need to do is send us an informal email to the above address.

Please note that the foregoing rights are subject to legal restrictions and may interfere with or make impossible the provision of our services.
