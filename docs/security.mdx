## Smart Account Security

ARMA's security foundation is built on a self-custodial architecture that ensures users maintain exclusive control over their funds. The system is designed so that Giza never stores or has access to private keys, while session keys operate under strict time and protocol limitations. All smart contracts undergo rigorous audits, and users can instantly revoke permissions, providing an additional layer of security and control.

## Access Controls

The platform implements a sophisticated wallet-to-wallet authentication system where admin rights are exclusively restricted to the user's wallet. Session keys operate under carefully defined parameters, limiting interactions to specifically approved protocols, predetermined timeframes, and predefined actions with maximum transaction limits. The system is designed to prevent catch-all permissions ensuring robust security at every level.

## Risk Management

ARMA employs a comprehensive risk management framework that starts with limiting protocol exposure to carefully selected platforms. All operations maintain complete transparency through detailed transaction histories and status tracking. The platform focuses on stable lending yields and ensures users can always return to their original token upon withdrawal. Regular security audits and comprehensive system monitoring create a secure operational environment with full traceability of all actions.
