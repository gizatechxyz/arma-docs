## 2. Agent Logic Software

### 2.1 Overview

The use of the Agent Logic Software enables you to automate the execution of your trading strategies ("**Strategies**") in relation to third-party DeFi protocols ("**DeFi Protocols**") by enabling your Smart Accounts (as defined in Section 3) to query and process data generated by the Agent Logic Software.

### 2.2 Agent Logic Software and Strategies

The Agent Logic Software is an off-chain software that generates data and standardized transaction messages ("**Sign Requests**") in relation to the Strategies. Sign Requests are sent to the connected Smart Accounts for signature and execution (see Section 8). The Sign Requests are generated in accordance with the pre-defined Strategies in relation to the DeFi Protocols accepted by you.

By using the Agent Logic Software, you understand and accept that we make no representations, warranties or covenants with respect to the quality, purpose, result or performance of any Sign Requests and/or data generated by the Agent Logic Software.

## 3. Smart Accounts

### 3.1 Overview

Smart Accounts are smart contracts that sign and trigger the execution of the Sign Requests. The Smart Accounts are deployed and controlled by your external owned account ("**EOA**" or "**Wallet**") and are able to access, hold and interact with your digital assets associated with your EOA within your defined permissions ("**Permissions**") by using the session keys ("**Session Keys**") generated by your EOA. Session Keys enable the Smart Accounts to sign Sign Requests in an automated manner, thereby triggering the execution of on-chain transactions. You acknowledge and understand that transactions that are signed by your Smart Accounts are executed on the underlying blockchain networks without our involvement. We do not execute transactions on your behalf, we do not control the execution of transactions initiated by you and we do not take any responsibility and shall not be liable regarding said transactions.

The Smart Contacts and the Session Keys will always remain under the control of your EOA and you will be able to redefine and/or revoke Permissions at any time.

### 3.2 Smart Accounts and DeFi Protocols not Operated by Gizatech

Neither the Smart Accounts nor the DeFi Protocols are controlled and/or operated by us. We do not act as an administrator or operator of the DeFi Protocols, Smart Accounts and/or Sessions Keys, and do not have access to the digital assets that are held in your EOA, Smart Accounts and/or in the smart contracts of the DeFi Protocols.

You understand and acknowledge that when your Smart Account is signing a Sign Request (i.e., providing liquidity, swapping, or depositing digital assets on DeFi Protocols), you are not interacting with us, but directly with the DeFi Protocols. Furthermore, we do not store, send, support you in the transfer of, or receive your digital assets when your Smart Account is signing Sign Requests.

We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the functioning and operation of the Smart Accounts, DeFi Protocols, their individual components, or for any of your digital assets.

We further make no representations, warranties or covenants with respect to the Smart Accounts and DeFi Protocols (or any implementations and/or components thereof), including, but not limited to, with regard to their technical properties and/or characteristics or performance, or their actual or potential usefulness or suitability for any particular purpose.

You shall use the Agent Logic Software only for the Designated Purpose and shall, except with our prior written consent, not provide access to or otherwise make the Agent Logic Software or the underlying source available to any third parties, whether in whole or in part.

## 8. Access to the Giza UI: Connecting Your EOA to the Giza UI and Smart Accounts

In order to deploy and interact with your Smart Accounts via the Giza UI, you must first connect one of the third-party EOA listed under the "Connect" tab to the Giza UI. EOA or Wallets store and manage the private keys to the blockchain addresses that were created with the Wallet or manually imported into the EOA. As these EOA store the private keys which are required to sign transactions on-chain, they can be used to execute transactions and publish them to the underlying blockchain networks.

When you connect your EOA, the Giza UI will ask for permission to deploy Smart Accounts. During this process, you will be able to define the Permissions and your EOA will generate the Session Keys. You can modify these Permissions at any time in the settings of your EOA or via the Giza UI. Please note that you can only interact with Smart Accounts that are both managed by your EOA and connected to the Giza UI.

The use of EOA is subject to the terms and conditions of the respective provider. We have no control over the blockchain addresses that are managed by your EOA and connected to the Giza UI and no ability to access any assets that are held thereon. You are solely responsible for the security of the EOA, your Smart Accounts and Session Keys as well as the corresponding private keys and passwords. We do not assume any responsibility for the connected EOA, regardless of whether or not they are used to effectuate transactions and shall not be liable for any damages arising out of or related to your use of the EOA or your inability to connect or use the EOA and/or Smart Accounts to execute transactions.

Your interactions with the Smart Accounts and DeFi Protocols may be subject to the payment of the following fees ("**Blockchain Fees**"):

- **Gas Fees**: All interactions with the underlying blockchain networks require the payment of a network transaction fee ("**Gas Fee**") which is paid to the validators of the underlying blockchain networks. The Gas Fee required to execute a transaction depends on the activity on the underlying blockchain networks and is entirely outside of our control.

- **DeFi Protocol Fees**: You may be required to pay fees ("**DeFi Protocol Fees**") for interactions with the DeFi Protocols. The DeFi Protocol Fees are entirely outside of our control.

By interacting with your Smart Accounts through the Giza UI and using the Agent Logic Software for the generation of Sign Requests, you acknowledge and agree that the Blockchain Fees are non-refundable under any circumstances. You also understand and accept that the Blockchain Fees required to execute transactions are subject to circumstances beyond our control.

These Terms enters into force upon your use of the Agent Logic Software and/or access to the Agent UI for an indefinite period of time until terminated by one of the Parties as set forth below ("**Term**").

We have the right to terminate these Terms at any time with immediate effect (without prior notice).

You have the right to terminate these Terms at any time with immediate effect (without prior notice) by revoking the Permissions of your Smart Accounts.

If we terminate these Terms, we may cease your access and use of the Agent Logic Software and the Giza UI right away, without prior notice. In this case, you will no longer be able to use the Agent Logic Software and you will no longer need to pay Agent Fees. In any case, in the event of termination, you shall have no claim against us.
