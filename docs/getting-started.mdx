Follow these steps to start using ARMA:

## Prerequisites

To begin using ARMA, you'll need a compatible Web3 wallet such as MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, or Rabby. ARMA accepts deposits in USDC with a minimum amount of 5 USDC and a maximum of 1,000 USDC during our initial release phase. The platform is designed to be accessible to both experienced DeFi users and newcomers to yield optimization.

## Activation

1. **Connecting Your Wallet**
   
   Getting started with ARMA is straightforward. Simply click "Connect Wallet" on the platform interface, select your preferred wallet provider from the supported options, and approve the connection request

   This establishes the secure connection needed for all future interactions with ARMA.

2. **Creating Your Smart Account**
   
   ARMA utilizes smart account technology to enhance security and enable automated operations. When you first activate ARMA, a smart account is automatically created and configured to delegate specific protocol interactions to the agent. This wallet technology uses your existing wallet as a secure way to sign transactions.
   
   Consider naming it "ARMA Smart Account" for easy reference.
   
   This one-time setup process includes signing the required permissions to enable ARMA's automated features.

3. **Initial Deposit**
   
   ARMA's architecture accepts deposits from any blockchain network, making it convenient to fund your position.

   Select your deposit token (USDC), specify the amount you wish to deposit and approve.
   
   The platform supports direct deposits from Ethereum mainnet, streamlining the funding process.

4. **Setting Agent Parameters**
   
   Once funded, you'll configure your agent's operating parameters.
   
   This includes confirming which protocols ARMA will interact with and setting your preferred timeframe for agent operations.

5. **Activate Agent** 
   
   Once you set your agent parameters, you can move forward with activating your agent. 
   
   This will authorize the transfer of your tokens to your secure smart account and one-time session key creation allowing ARMA to perform yield optimization operations.
  
   Your funds will now be automatically managed by ARMA for optimal yields.

## Monitoring

ARMA provides comprehensive monitoring tools to track your position's performance. The dashboard displays your total balance and earnings, including percentage gains since activation. Performance charts offer flexible timeframe options from daily to yearly views, enabling detailed analysis of your position's growth.

Your current position details are clearly displayed, showing initial deposit amount, activation date, current protocol allocation, and APR. The platform maintains a complete transaction history, providing a chronological record of all agent actions with detailed information including transaction types, amounts, and verification status.

## Deactivation

You maintain full control over your position with a simple deactivation process. When initiated, ARMA efficiently unwinds your positions, converts assets back to your original deposit token, and revokes all session keys. The process includes automated calculation and collection of any accrued performance fees, ensuring a clean and complete withdrawal of your funds.
