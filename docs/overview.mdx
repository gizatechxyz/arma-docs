ARMA is an autonomous yield optimization agent designed to maximize returns on stablecoin deposits (USDC and USDT) across Mode Network's leading lending protocols: Ionic, Layerbank, and Ironclad. The agent automatically evaluates and reallocates funds to the highest-yielding pools while minimizing transaction costs and risks.
