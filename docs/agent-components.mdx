## Smart Account Architecture

At the core of ARMA's security framework is its self-custodial smart account architecture. Each smart account is automatically created during activation and remains under the complete control of the user's wallet. This architecture ensures that Giza never has access to private keys or funds, while enabling secure management of deposited assets and protocol interactions. The smart account serves as a secure foundation for all of ARMA's automated operations.

## Session Keys

ARMA utilizes advanced session key technology to enable automated yield optimization while maintaining robust security. These keys grant specific, limited permissions for interacting with selected protocols and operate within strict time-bound authorizations. Users maintain full control, with the ability to revoke permissions at any time. All operations are secured through smart contract permissions, ensuring that session keys can never access user funds directly.

## Execution Module

ARMA's execution module orchestrates all agent operations with maximum efficiency. This component handles the precise scheduling of transactions, optimizes timing for protocol interactions, and ensures reliable execution of all operations. The module operates as the operational backbone of ARMA, coordinating all automated actions while maintaining security and performance.
