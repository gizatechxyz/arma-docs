## Fee Structure

ARMA operates on a performance-based model with a 10% success fee applied only to the yield generated from your position. This fee is calculated and charged upon withdrawal, with complete transparency provided through the dashboard's detailed fee calculation display.

## Protocol Rewards Management

The agent automatically handles reward collection from all integrated protocols, ensuring no yield is left unclaimed. These rewards are distributed to you upon withdrawal along with your principal and generated yield.

## Token Management

ARMA is designed to be user-friendly with no deposit or withdrawal fees. Regardless of which protocols or tokens are used during yield optimization, you'll always receive your funds back in your original deposit token upon withdrawal, providing predictability and convenience.
