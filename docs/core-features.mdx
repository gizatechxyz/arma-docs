ARMA's infrastructure is built on a self-custodial smart account architecture that ensures complete user control over their funds. Using account abstraction technology, the system guarantees that Giza never has access to users' private keys or funds while enabling automated yield optimization.

The agent continuously evaluates lending rates across protocols and automatically rebalances positions to capture the highest yields. When more profitable opportunities arise in different tokens, ARMA performs automated asset swaps to maximize returns while considering all associated costs.

Security and control are maintained through session key-based authorization, allowing ARMA to execute specific operations while keeping user funds secure. The intuitive dashboard provides real-time performance monitoring, detailed transaction history, and comprehensive reporting. Users maintain complete control with one-click withdrawal available at any time.
