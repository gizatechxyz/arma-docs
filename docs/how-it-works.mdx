## Smart Account Architecture

ARMA utilizes a smart account architecture powered by account abstraction. This means:

1. Your funds are held in a smart contract wallet that only you control
2. The ARMA agent receives limited permissions through session keys
3. You maintain full custody and can revoke access at any time

## Yield Optimization Process

The agent follows a systematic approach to optimize yields:

1. **Market Analysis**: Continuously monitors yield rates across supported protocols
2. **Opportunity Evaluation**: Calculates potential returns accounting for:
   - Current APY rates
   - Gas costs for transactions
   - Minimum position sizes
   - Protocol risks

3. **Position Management**: 
   - Opens new positions when profitable opportunities are identified
   - Closes positions when better opportunities arise
   - Maintains optimal position sizes for maximum returns

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Diversifies positions across protocols
   - Monitors protocol health and TVL
   - Implements safety thresholds and circuit breakers
