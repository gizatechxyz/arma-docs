**What protocols does ARMA interact with?**

ARMA optimizes yields across multiple lending protocols in Base and Mode Network.

**What tokens can I deposit?**

USDC / USDT is supported. Minimum deposit is $10 in Mode and $100 in Base.

**How does ARMA make decisions?**

ARMA uses an off-chain logic to monitor lending rates across protocols and automatically moves funds to the highest-yielding opportunities when profitable. ARMA determines optimal timing for position changes and executes moves only when the yield difference justifies transaction costs.

**How safe are my funds?**

Your funds remain under your control through a smart account. ARMA never has access to your private keys or wallet, and can only interact with approved protocols. The smart account architecture ensures only you maintain control of your funds.

**What are the fees?**

10% success fee on generated yield, charged upon withdrawal. No deposit or withdrawal fees.

**Can I withdraw and deactivate ARMA anytime?**

Yes. You can deactivate ARMA at any time and receive your funds in your original deposit token.

**How do I monitor performance?**

The dashboard shows your current balance, earnings, APR, and complete transaction history.

**What happens to accrued yield?**

All accrued yield is automatically claimed, converted, and compounded to maximize returns.

**Does Giza have access to my wallet?**

No. Giza never has access to your private keys, seed phrases, or wallet permissions. We use smart account technology that delegates only specific protocol interactions for yield optimization.
